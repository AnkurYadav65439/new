two ways to upload folder (i.e. 'new' folder) on github

first thing is to initialize git with cmd 
   as it is reuiqred for git to know the user name 
command : git config --global user.name "userNAME" and user.email "userMAIL"

then  

// first way 
1. Go inside the folder which have to be pushed in command then execute the git commands
make repository on github without readme tick
which shows some commands to follow 
 just add an extra command after 'add README' that is "git add ."

  atlast reload the githubb page
